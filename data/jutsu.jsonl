In this form, the user's combat ability is greatly enhanced; allowing the use of the clan's high-level techniques such as Butterfly Bullet Bombing, and the ability to use the chakra wings to create gusts of chakra.\nThere are two methods of entering this mode. The first is through use of the Akimichi's Three Coloured Pills, which aggressively convert all of the user's calories into chakra; if the pills are not regulated properly, the user may die from the rapid weight loss. Practised users are able to convert their calories into chakra on their own through a process known as Calorie Control (\u30ab\u30ed\u30ea\u30fc\u30b3\u30f3\u30c8\u30ed\u30fc\u30eb , Karor\u012b Kontor\u014dru); because they are in complete control of how much of their body weight is turned into chakra, it poses less of a risk to the user.\nIn the anime, it is shown that using this form without proper control will in fact greatly diminish one's performance.[2] It is also shown that even while in this slim state, the user can still perform various expansion techniques.[3]\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 271\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 67\n\n\u2191 Boruto episode 156"}

The dragon itself is capable of flight, and, while Deidara is safely on its back, the dragon can spit out smaller clay figures that attack the opponent like guided missiles.\nThese independent missile-like creatures take the form of a greatly reduced version of the larger dragon that created them, however, despite this decrease in size they are still relatively larger than a normal person. Each is capable of tracking their intended target and producing a significant explosion proportional to size upon contact but as they emerge, they consume a substantial amount of clay from the original dragon, initially extracting it from the creature's tail. This ultimately limits the number that each C2 \"Dragon\" is capable of creating, before clay must be sacrificed from more vital areas, such as the body or wings. By using more clay, the missile's size and explosive power can be substantially increased.\nThe dragon can also produce clay mines at the expense of clay, that take the form of small spherical creatures, which can be subsequently manipulated to force opponents to fight in a limited space. This is achieved through the use of Tobi's Earth Release: Hiding Like a Mole Technique, to hide a large amount of these mines underground, without the opponents' knowledge to their exact location.

If successful, she follows with Falling Rock Warning (\u843d\u77f3\u6ce8\u610f, Chikusekich\u016bi), cutting a wire to make multiple rocks fall on the target.\nIn Jump Super Stars, Sakura makes four blocks of wood fall around her.

Understanding this theory, the Body Revival Technique can repair the user's body and increase its strength by manipulating the \"Destruction and Rebirth\" cycle of the muscles.\nThis technique allows the user to survive any otherwise normally fatal damage and instantly heal from the damage. A unique trait of this technique is that it can momentarily give the user the appearance of death, fooling even the most talented medical-nins.\nWhen combined with Dark Chakra, this technique can also be used to physically enhance the person's speed, strength and healing capabilities to superhuman levels. It also alters the person's physical appearance drastically, making them younger and more fit in looks, greatly bulking their muscular physique. By Shinn\u014d's claim, this form allows him to perform techniques that are normally taxing for the body, including open all Eight Gates, without any drawbacks. However, if the user loses proper control over the dark chakra while performing this technique, it can cause severe backlash that can destroy the body."}

If users are fast enough, they can use this brief lapse in the opponent's attentions to stage a counterattack;[1] in the anime, the replacement log itself has been shown used as an attack, being applied with explosive tags.[2] Alternatively, this is a good opportunity for users to escape.[1]\nThe Body Replacement Technique can evidently only be used in response to what would be harmful attacks: Pain only escapes from Jiraiya's Wild Lion's Mane Technique when Jiraiya tries to kill him with it; when Jiraiya uses the same technique to only keep Pain restrained, Pain remains captured.[3]"}

The spring water produced by The Hole appears to catalyse and speed up the recreation process because of the large \"life force\" flowing through it.[1] The downside to the accelerated rate at which the clone matures is that the snakes composing it have a very short lifespan, resulting in the clone splitting apart and dying after approximately 48 hours.[2]\nOnce the clone is created, Kabuto is able to gain control of it by placing a special talisman into its head. Depending on the talisman used, the clone can either become a mindless tool under Kabuto's control, with eyes possessing black sclera and white irides, or allowed to access their genetic source's personality and memories, while possessing eyes with dark grey sclera and white, snake-like irides. Clones produced through this method are also able to use any abilities possessed by their original selves, including those that they did not naturally acquire.[3] While not in battle, Kabuto stored the clones he created within large snakes, which would burst out of the ground and release their contents when needed.\nKabuto first used this technique to create a clone of Akatsuki member Hidan by placing snakes containing his DNA into the water produced by The Hole, causing them to quickly form into a humanoid shape, and then giving it life with a talisman. Later, snakes which had been ingested by Naruto Uzumaki created a clone of him upon exiting his body; a process which had greatly weakened him over the course of a day and ultimately paralysed him. Unlike the clone of Hidan, this clone did not require the insertion of a talisman to gain life and, due to the influence of Kurama's chakra, was formed in Naruto's four-tailed Version 2 state and possessed a strangely coloured body as well as a tail. The clone was also capable of resisting the control of Kabuto's talisman once it was inserted.[3]"}

When she strikes a target with her hand, the electricity pours into their nervous system and rearranges their body's signals. Ordinarily, the brain sends electric signals to the body to control how it moves. But when under the influence of this technique, these signals will produce any movement other than what the brain intends. When used against most opponents, they will be unable to do something as simple as walking, much less continue fighting.[1]\nThe target can partially overcome this technique if they manage to relearn the connection between their brain and their limbs, as Kabuto Yakushi demonstrates.

They are also able to protrude a set of flexible blades and drills or a series of mechanical tendrils from their arms, as well as quickly propel themselves forward by emitting a burst of chakra from holes in their feet. The user can also release a powerful chakra blast, which is capable of destroying numerous buildings at once, either by transforming one of their hands into a cannon or by opening the crown of their head.\nThe body through which Nagato channelled the Asura Path displayed enough raw physical power to rip Jiraiya's arm off and crush his throat with basic taijutsu, as well as to throw the Animal Path all the way into Konohagakure from the outskirts of the village. Additionally, the Asura Path was able to survive otherwise fatal damage due to its mechanised insides. All of these abilities befitted the \"warring demon\" name that the Asura Path held, whilst giving it a considerable degree of versatility.\n\n\nMechanisms[]\nThe detached hand being launched.As displayed through Nagato's Path, not only was the arm detachable, but a cluster of segmented missiles produced from within it.The arm itself could be used as a launching pad to launch the missiles.The Path's head opening up to reveal a cannon.The Path being propelled with mechanisms from the feet. The right hand also shows additional weapons being produced.Additional arms being equipped in battle.\nInfluences[]\nIn Buddhism, the Asura realm is the plane of semi-divine warring demons which people are reincarnated in due to actions based on jealousy, struggle, combat or rationalisation in a previous life, and though powerful, live in constant violence and conflict to which there is no resolution nor peace. Following a common depiction of Asura, this ability allows the user to possess six arms and three faces, each of which display a different emotion. Like Deva, Asura are also a race of supernatural beings. They are also featured in Hinduism as divine beings, and are known to live a life pursuing power, while indulgent and representative of materialistic and carnal pleasures. Both depictions play in the abilities of the Asura Path.\nIt also draws inspiration from Hinduism, where Asuras in mythology purportedly had the ability (called Astra) to use magical equivalents to modern day biological missiles.\n\nReferences[]\n\n\u2191 Fourth Databook, page 257\n\n\u2191 Naruto chapter 551, page 6"}

Next, Suna-nin would use their Wind Release: Air Current Wild Dance to manipulate the dust to further obscure the Uchiha's vision, while Aburame clan members and Kiri-nin would use their Insect Jamming Technique and Hiding in Mist Technique to impair their sensory skills. \nThe second step, to restrain the Ten-Tails, would see the Iwa-nin create a large sink hole with their Earth Release: Great Moving Earth Core, with their lava users covering the beast with quicklime, mixing it with the Kiri-nin's water.

When the fabrications decided to take matters into their own hands, the Akuta produced even went against \u014cnoki's orders.\n\nDevelopment[]\n\u014cnoki created this technique in response to a missing-nin's attack claiming the lives of many young shinobi.

Users control the chains as they extend outwards from their body, most commonly to wrap around targets and restrain them.[2] The chains are extremely durable, enough that even the Nine-Tails would struggle to destroy them.[1] In the anime, in addition to physically binding targets, the chains are said to neutralise their target by binding and nullifying their chakra.[3] Depending on the number and the length of chains that users intend to produce, they may prefer to initially create only a few chains, which they send underground to split apart and spread around the area as needed, leaving their immediate surroundings uncluttered.[4]\n\nThe chains creating a barrier.The chains binding the Nine-Tails within Kushina's subconscious.1/2\nA barrier can be erected between two or more sealing chains, which is quite impregnable: Kushina Uzumaki creates such a barrier to not only prevent the Nine-Tails from escaping a defined area, but also to prevent the Third Hokage from entering it.[5] Because the chains are made of the user's chakra, the chains can be produced anywhere the user's chakra resides. When she was the Nine-Tails' jinch\u016briki, Kushina used the chains to bind the Nine-Tails within her subconscious,[6] and for this reason she never once lost control of its power.[1] After her death, some of Kushina's chakra was sealed within her son, Naruto Uzumaki, allowing her to produce the chains from his body in order to help him combat the Nine-Tails.[2]\nDuring the Fourth Shinobi World War, Karin awakens the ability to produce similar chains, which she uses to lash against and ultimately destroy a wooden opponent.

As strange as it seems, Killer B is extremely skilled with these blades and this fighting style which he began adopting since a young age.[3] The most dangerous aspect of this style is the unpredictability of his movements, easily catching his opponents by surprise. He can spin in a manner similar to a buzz-saw, or else employing a series of unrelenting attacks switching the locations as well as the blades with which he attacks, leaving no openings for even a skilled Sharingan user like Sasuke Uchiha,[4] and a highly trained swordsman like Suigetsu H\u014dzuki, who remarked that the method of attack was completely unpredictable.[5] Killer B was also able to throw these swords from their normally awkward positions, either to hit his opponents from range, or to impale his opponent at close range and cause damage that would normally be lethal.[6]\nThe swords can be charged with lightning chakra to greatly increase their cutting power through high-frequency vibrations.[7] Because of the streamline shape of these swords, they serve as fairly good projectiles as well.[8] In the anime Killer B was able to use the Eight-Tails' tentacle to extend his reach for a surprise attack.[9]"}
